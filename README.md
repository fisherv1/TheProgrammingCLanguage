The Programming C language

This is for all the exercises I did for The Programming C Language.

Chapter One:

1.13 Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

1.14 Write a program to print a histogram of the fequencies of different  characters in its input.

1.15 Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function for conversion

1.16 Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as possible of the text.

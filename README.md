The Programming C language

This is for all the exercises I did for The Programming C Language.

Chapter One:

1.13 Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

1.14 Write a program to print a histogram of the fequencies of different characters in its input.
